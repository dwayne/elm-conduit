> [Elm](https://elm-lang.org) codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld][RealWorld] spec and API.

### [Demo](https://elm-conduit.netlify.app)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld][RealWorld]

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.
